# WordSearch
This program automates the popular 'word search' puzzle we see in newspapers or kids-flyers.
It is written in C# and Winforms.
It has an UI which lets you place words either horizontally or vertically on the grid.
After all the words have been placed, the grid is filled up with random alphabets for camouflaging.
The grid contents can to be exported to a csv file and printed out.
Please find a screenshot/glance of the whole program in action.
